<h2>Missions</h2>
<p>There are several adventures in my life I am proud of that prove the kind of ogre I am.</p>

  <tr>
	<td>Retrieve Princess Fiona from the highest room in the tallest tower</td>
	<td>Myself, Donkey</td>
	<td>First <strong>ever</strong> successful retrieval attempt (approximately 30 previous tries - proven by the 30 skeletons charred in the tower).</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
	<td>Get people out of my swamp!</td>
	<td>Myself, Donkey</td>
	<td>EDIT 100% - Not only did we get my swamp back, but also we were able to send other creatures back to their rightful land.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
	<td>Save Princess Fiona and the people of Duloc from the dictator Lord Farquaad</td>
	<td>Myself, Donkey, Dragon</td>
	<td>EDIT Lord Farquaad was not Princess Fiona's true love, therefore their first kiss wouldn't stop her from becoming an ogre at night. A creative way (if I do say so myself) to do so was to crash their wedding. The people were saved from Farquaad thanks in large part to Dragon... *burp*</td>
  </tr>
  
  <td>Defeat Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming's attempt at a royal coup</td>
	<td>Myself, Donkey, Puss in Boots, Big Bad Wolf, Pinoocchio, The Three Blind Mice, Gingy, Mongo</td>
	<td>We worked together as a team to crash Prince Charming's big night where he attempted to trick Fiona into Fairy Godmother's trap.</td>
