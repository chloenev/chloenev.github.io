<h2>More About Me</h2>
<p>Most people assume that all there is to ogres is that they're ugly, mean, and stinky. Those people would be right, but I'm also much more! Like an onion, I have layers. I like and dislike lots of things.</p>

<p><strong>Dancing - </strong>
There's nothing like a good dance with the lads and the wife. As soon as I hear some Smash Mouth or Ricky Martin there's no controlling this guy. Last time me and the crew heard Livin' La Vida Loca??? Donkey and Puss hopped on the mic and Fiona and myself hit the dance floor. 
Here's some <a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9PYzGyIfF8" target="_blank">proof</a> if you don't believe me.

<p><strong>Slime - </strong>
Now this one might come as a big surprise to some, but I love playing with slime. After a long day of listening to Donkey I need something to help me relax and this is the perfect thing. I've found some great ones that make me feel right at home:
<ul>
<li><a class="external" href="https://ogslimes.com/collections/all-slimes/products/soil-mix-1" target="_blank">Soil Mix:</a> This one reminds me of my swamp, how could I not love it!</li>
<li><a class="external" href="https://ogslimes.com/collections/all-slimes/products/exorcist-vomit" target="_blank">Exorcist Vomit:</a> C'mon, just the name should be enough! The colour of the slime is also quite nice if I say so myself. I would describe it as an equally beautiful and distasteful yellow-ish green - kind of like the colour of my skin and this website!</li>
<li><a class="external" href="https://ogslimes.com/collections/all-slimes/products/rotten-spa-towel" target="_blank">Rotten Spa Towel:</a> Now this one is perfectly disgusting. Bought this one for the wife's birthday and she loved it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Halloween - </strong>
A night of scaring people, wearing masks, (fake) blood and (pumpkin) guts, and watching spooky movies is my idea of a good time. Giving the kid's a wee fright is always fun too.</p>


<h3>Dislikes</h3>
<p><strong>Fairy Godmothers - </strong>I think this one's pretty self-explanatory...</p>
